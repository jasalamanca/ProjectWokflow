# ProjectWokflow
A CMake module to ease package config file creation

## Why to use ProjectWorkflow
Main motivation to write this CMake module is to automate very common patterns when creating packages.

Obviously this is a very simple and incomplete module. Mainly because packaging is a complex subject and 
also because is not my purpose to write a complete module for everybody.

If this simple packaging methods help you, feel free to use ProjectWorkflow.

Of course, comments and patches are welcomed, but be aware that this project is an experiment and my lack of spare time.

## How to use ProjectWorkflow

To use this module simply copy cmake directory to your project and add 
```cmake
# ProjectWorkflow cmake modules
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "<path_to_cmake>")
```
to your CMakeLists.txt

> üìù As you have CMake experience, you know that *CMAKE_MODULE_PATH* could be passed from command line as a more general method.

## Modules documentation
ProjectWorkflow provides:
  - [ProjectWorkflow](#projectworkflow-module) to ease installing packages and using semver versioning schema.
  - [semver](#semver-module) with semver support commands.
  
### ProjectWorkflow module

[PW_install(PACKAGE)](#PW_installPACKAGE)
```cmake
PW_install(
    PACKAGE <pkg_name> 
    [VERSION <version>]
    [COMPATIBILITY Semver|AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|SameMinorVersion|ExactVersion]
    [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
    [EXPORTS <export_name> ... ]
    [PACKAGES <pkg_name> ... ])
```

#### PW_install(PACKAGE)
PW_install(PACKAGE) generates targets export files, package config file and a package version file in a coherent manner.

Apply common parameters to install(EXPORT), configure_package_config_file and install(FILES) typical sequence of commands.

Also generates a stereotypical input file for configure_package_config_file, avoiding this boilerplate.

If you want to use semver versions remember:
- You MUST set <PROJECT_NAME>_VERSION to semver you want.

  after calling *project* command because semver version are incompatible with *project* command.

  and before callin *PW_install* or *semver_write_version_config* commands.
```cmake
example
    project(MyProject VERSION 1.2.3)
    set(MyProject_VERSION "1.2.3-alpha+build3")
```
- You can pass VERSION parameter to *PW_install* or *semver_write_version_config* commands if you need to change version on generated configuration files.
- You MUST set <PACKAGE_NAME>_FIND_SEMVER_VERSION before calling *find_package* command, because semver versions cannot be passed in directly via the *find_package* command.
```cmake
example (to locate version "1.2.3-alpha+build3")
   set(OtherProject_FIND_SEMVER_VERSION "1.2.3-alpha+build3")
   find_package(OtherProject 1.2.3)
example (to locate range "1.2.3-alpha+build3...<2")
   set(OtherProject_FIND_SEMVER_VERSION "1.2.3-alpha+build3...<2")
   find_package(OtherProject 1.2.3...<2)
```

Parameters:
- **PACKAGE** Introduces the package name.
- **VERSION** Sets package version. If not set, <PROJECT_NAME>_VERSION is used.
- **COMPATIBILITY** Sets package version mode. If not set, 'Semver' is used.

  Semver is new for semantic version support.
  The rest are supported by *write_basic_package_version_file*.

- **NAMESPACE** Sets package namespace. If not set, *<pkg_name>::* is used.
- **EXPORTS** For each <export_name> indicated, a target export file is generated and is included with the necessary path.
- **PACKAGES** For each <pkg_name> indicated, a *find_package* is included in configuration file, with necessary parameters.

*PW_install(PACKAGE)* will generate:
- *<pkg_name>Config.cmake*
- *<pkg_name>ConfigVersion.cmake*
- *<export_name>.cmake* for each indicated <export_name>

### semver module

[semver_write_version_config()](#semver_write_version_config)
```cmake
semver_write_version_config(<filename>
    [VERSION <version>])
```

[semver_matches](#semver_matches)
```cmake
semver_matches(<version> <spec> <matches> <exact>)
```

[semver_toCMakeVersion](#semver_toCMakeVersion)
```cmake
semver_toCMakeVersion(<version> <version_cmake>)
```

#### semver_write_version_config()
Builds a configuration version file for semver versions and writes it to *filename*.

Parameters:
- **filename** The filename where to write version file.
- **VERSION** Sets package version. If not set, <PROJECT_NAME>_VERSION is used.

#### semver_matches()
Checks if semver <version> matches semver version specification <spec>.

Sets <matches> according to the check and <exact> will be true if and only if <version> and <spec> represent the same semver version.

Parameters:
- **version** The version to be checked.
> <semver_version> ::= <basic>[-<prerelease>][+<build_metadata>]
>   Each part follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)
- **spec** Cmake semver specification to be matched. Follows cmake ranges specification.
> <semver_range> ::= <semver_spec>[(...|...<)<semver_spec>]
>  <semver_spec> ::= <basic_spec>[-<prerelease>][+<build_metadata>]
>   <basic_spec> ::= <number>[.<number>[.<number>]]
>     Every missing <number> is substituted by 0 to form a version <basic> version.
>     See [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) for details.
- **matches** True or false indicating if <version> matches <spec>.
- **exact** True if <version> and <spec> represent same semver version.

#### semver_toCMakeVersion()
If receives a semver version then returns <base> part, else returns full version received.

Parameters:
- **version** A possibly semver version.
- **version_cmake** <version> transformed to be compatible with CMake versions.
